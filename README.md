Problem: Design analytics dashboard for timestamped tank operation cycles with KPIs, charts, and time/tank filtering.

My Solution: A Next.js + D3 visualization dashboard displaying an `Efficiency over Time` time-series line chart and a stacked bar chart displaying KPI(total metric usage and savings) for each tank.
